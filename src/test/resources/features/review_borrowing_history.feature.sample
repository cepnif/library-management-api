Feature: View Borrowing History
  Description:
  As a library member
  I want to view my borrowing history
  So that I can see a record of all books I have borrowed.

  Background:
    Given the member has logged in with a valid token

  Scenario Outline: Retrieve borrowing history based on records
    Given the member has <history_status> borrowing history
    When the member views their borrowing history with:
      | field    | value       |
      | username | validUser   |
    Then the request should return status <status_code>
    And the response should indicate "<message>"

    Examples:
      | history_status | status_code | message                 |
      | records        | 200         | borrowing history found |
      | no records     | 200         | no borrowing records    |

  Scenario: View history with an invalid token
    Given the member has an invalid authorization token
    When the member views their borrowing history with valid details
    Then the request should return status 401
    And the response should indicate "authorization failure"

  Scenario: View history with missing username
    When the member views their borrowing history without providing a username
    Then the request should return status 400
    And the response should indicate "missing parameter"
