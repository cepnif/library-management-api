Feature: Search Books by Author
  Description:
  As a library user
  I want to search for books by author
  So that I can find books by specific authors in the library.

  Background:
    Given the search API is available

  Scenario Outline: Search for books by author
    When a GET request is sent to "/books/author/<author>"
    Then the request should return status <status_code>
    And the response should indicate "<message>"

    Examples:
      | author        | status_code | message            |
      | JKRowling     | 200         | books by author    |
      | UnknownAuthor | 200         | no results found   |
      |               | 404         | missing parameter  |
