Feature: Check Book Availability
  Description:
  As a library user
  I want to check the availability of a book
  So that I can know if copies are available for borrowing.

  Background:
    Given the availability API is available

  Scenario Outline: Check availability of a book by title
    When a GET request is sent to "/books/availability/<title>"
    Then the request should return status <status_code>
    And the response should indicate "<message>"

    Examples:
      | title           | status_code | message                |
      | HarryPotter     | 200         | available copies       |
      | PopularBook     | 200         | zero available copies  |
      | UnknownBook     | 404         | book not found         |
      |                 | 400         | missing parameter      |
