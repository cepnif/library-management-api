Feature: Search Book by Title
  Description:
  As a library user
  I want to search for books by title
  So that I can find specific books available in the library.

  Background:
    Given the search API is available

  Scenario Outline: Search for a book by title
    When a GET request is sent to "/books/title/<title>"
    Then the request should return status <status_code>
    And the response should indicate "<message>"

    Examples:
      | title            | status_code | message            |
      | HarryPotter      | 200         | books found        |
      | NonExistentTitle | 200         | no results found   |
      |                  | 404         | missing parameter  |
