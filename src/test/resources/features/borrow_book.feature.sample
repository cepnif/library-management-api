Feature: Borrow a Book
  Description:
  As a library member
  I want to borrow a book
  So that I can take it out for reading.

  Background:
    Given the member has logged in with a valid token

  Scenario Outline: Borrow a book with different availability statuses
    Given the book <title> has <availability> copies available
    When the member borrows the book with:
      | field    | value       |
      | title    | <title>     |
      | username | validUser   |
    Then the request should return status <status_code>
    And the response should indicate "<message>"

    Examples:
      | title           | availability | status_code | message               |
      | AvailableBook   | available    | 201         | book borrowed         |
      | UnavailableBook | none         | 400         | book unavailable      |

  Scenario: Attempt to borrow with an invalid token
    Given the member has an invalid authorization token
    When the member borrows the book with valid details
    Then the request should return status 401
    And the response should indicate "authorization failure"
