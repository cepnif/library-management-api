Feature: Return a Book
  Description:
  As a library member
  I want to return a borrowed book
  So that it becomes available for other members.

  Background:
    Given the member has logged in with a valid token

  Scenario Outline: Return a book with different borrowing statuses
    Given the book <title> has been <borrow_status> by the user
    When the member returns the book with:
      | field    | value       |
      | title    | <title>     |
      | username | validUser   |
    Then the request should return status <status_code>
    And the response should indicate "<message>"

    Examples:
      | title          | borrow_status | status_code | message                       |
      | BorrowedBook   | borrowed      | 200         | book returned successfully    |
      | NotBorrowedBook| not borrowed  | 404         | no active borrowing record    |

  Scenario: Return attempt with an invalid token
    Given the member has an invalid authorization token
    When the member returns the book with valid details
    Then the request should return status 401
    And the response should indicate "authorization failure"
